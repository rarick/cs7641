# Installing required packages
I've included a requirements.txt which lists the packages required by this project.

See the instructions for your package manager on how to install packages
from a requirements.txt, or just read and install them manually.

# Running the code
To run the code, simply call `python3 main.py`. This will generate all
the tables and plots  using the project report. **BE WARNED**: these
plots and tables can take a lot of time to generate (approx. 30 minutes).
